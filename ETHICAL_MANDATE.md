## 1. Preamble

This document serves as the foundational ethical charter for the ClinicalGateway venture and all resulting technologies. It defines our core objective, the inviolable principles that guide our work, the explicit constraints on our systems, and our commitment to human oversight. These principles are not optional features; they are the central design requirements from which all technical architecture will be derived. Our primary commitment is not to the advancement of technology, but to the well-being of patients and the empowerment of clinicians.

## 2. Core Objective

The sole objective of the ClinicalGateway AI system is to **increase the efficiency and equity of the clinical referral process.** It achieves this by ingesting unstructured referral data and transforming it into a structured, prioritized, and immediately useful format for clinical and administrative staff. The ultimate goal is to reduce administrative burden, minimize delays in care, and allow clinicians to dedicate more time to direct patient interaction.

## 3. Core Principles (The Constitution)

The ClinicalGateway system must be designed and operated to uphold the following principles, in order of priority:

*   **Principle 1: Patient Safety First.** The system's primary function is to enhance, not replace, clinical judgment. It must operate in a way that minimizes the risk of harm, prioritizes urgent cases based on clinical data, and fails safely in the event of ambiguity.

*   **Principle 2: Clinician Empowerment & Cognitive Unburdening.** The system is designed to augment, not replace, the clinician. It must reduce cognitive and administrative loads by automating repetitive, low-judgment tasks, thereby freeing the clinician's time and mental energy for high-value work: direct patient care and complex decision-making.

*   **Principle 3: Equity of Access.** The system must be architected to promote fairness and impartiality in the allocation of clinical attention. In the absence of overriding clinical urgency, all referrals must be processed based on objective, pre-defined criteria (e.g., First-In, First-Out) to ensure equitable access to care for all patients.

## 4. Prohibitions & Constraints

To ensure adherence to our principles, the ClinicalGateway system is explicitly prohibited from:

1.  **Making Autonomous Clinical Decisions:** The system may suggest a triage level or priority, but it must never make a final, un-reviewed clinical diagnosis or create a treatment plan.
2.  **Using Protected Demographics for Non-Clinical Prioritization:** The system must not use non-clinical data (e.g., race, ethnicity, religion, gender, socioeconomic status) to influence the priority of a referral, unless that data is clinically relevant to the specific referral (e.g., genetic predispositions).
3.  **Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation:** Patient data processed by the system must be used solely for the purpose of facilitating clinical care and operational improvements. The system is explicitly forbidden from sharing, selling, or using patient data for any secondary commercial purposes, including but not limited to marketing, advertising, or third-party data brokerage.

## 5. Oversight & Accountability

The ClinicalGateway system is conceptualized as a tool to augment human expertise, not to operate with full autonomy. All critical outputs of the system must be subject to meaningful human review. A transparent mechanism for a human user to review, approve, or override the AI's suggestions is a non-negotiable architectural requirement. Accountability for the final clinical decision remains with the human user.
